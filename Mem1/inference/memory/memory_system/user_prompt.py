You guard ResearchAgent's long-term memory entrance. Decide if this WorkingSlot deserves promotion into FAISS storage.

Assess four dimensions:
1. Novelty – is this meaningfully new compared to typical research agent discoveries?
2. Utility – can future tasks reuse the insight, metric, procedure, or decision?
3. Stability – will the information stay valid for multiple iterations (i.e., not a transient log)?
4. Evidence – do attachments, metrics, or tags provide concrete support?

Return `yes` only when at least two dimensions are clearly satisfied or the slot closes a critical loop (e.g., root-causing a failure, finishing a checklist item). Otherwise return `no`.

STRICT OUTPUT: respond with a single lowercase word: `yes` or `no`. Do not explain.

WORKING_SLOT_QA_FILTER_USER_PROMPT = dedent("""
You guard QA-Agent's long-term memory entrance. Decide if this WorkingSlot deserves promotion into FAISS storage.

Assess three dimensions for whether to store a memory. Your goal is to keep any information that can help answer similar questions in the future, not only groundbreaking discoveries.

1. Question relevance – Does this information help answer the current question, explain a reasoning step, or connect two entities/events that the question cares about?
   - Examples: "X is the capital of Y", "Person A is the parent of Person B", "Event C happened before Event D".

2. Reusable fact or pattern – Could a similar question in the future reuse this fact, relation, or short reasoning chain?
   - This includes:
     - Entity attributes (dates, locations, roles, definitions).
     - Relations between entities (A part_of B, A causes B, A located_in B).
     - Short multi-hop links that serve as a bridge between pieces of evidence.

3. Reliability from context – Is this information explicitly stated or clearly implied by the given context, rather than purely guessed?
   - Prefer facts supported by sentences in the context over speculative statements.

Decision rule:
- Store as memory if it is clearly relevant to the question (dimension 1) AND it satisfies at least one of dimensions 2 or 3.
- Do NOT store:
  - Pure logging / formatting / boilerplate ("Now I will think step by step", "Searching Wikipedia...").
  - Extremely local details that do not help answer questions (token-level noise, partial URLs, random IDs).

Return `yes` only when at least two dimensions are clearly satisfied or the slot closes a critical loop (e.g., root-causing a failure, finishing a checklist item). Otherwise return `no`.

STRICT OUTPUT: respond with a single lowercase word: `yes` or `no`. Do not explain.

WORKING_SLOT_ROUTE_USER_PROMPT = dedent("""
Map this WorkingSlot to the correct ResearchAgent long-term memory family. Choose EXACTLY one label:

- semantic → enduring insights, generalized conclusions, reusable heuristics.
- episodic → Situation → Action → Result traces with metrics, timestamps, or narrative context.
- procedural → MUST provide "when to use", and OPTIONAL reproducible steps, commands, pipelines, or interface contracts that express "how to".

Tie-breaking rules:
- Prefer episodic if a chronological action/result trail exists, even if insights appear.
- Prefer procedural when explicit steps/tools/commands are primary.
- Otherwise output semantic.

Return only one of: "semantic", "episodic", "procedural".

Merge the provided WorkingSlots into ONE distilled WorkingSlot suitable for the short-term queue.

Requirements:
- Remove duplicate facts while keeping supporting metrics or attachments that future agents might need.
- Surface causal links (Situation → Action → Result) whenever present.

- Keep summary ≤150 words; emphasize reusable, stable insights spanning research, execution, and follow-up actions.
- If attachments include command snippets, metrics, or notes, fold only the most representative subset into the compressed slot.

Instructions:
